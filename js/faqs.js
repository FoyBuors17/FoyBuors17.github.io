    question: "Why are Bedrooms not included in Regular Clean?",
    answer: "It's been our experience that some people only want the main area of the house cleaned and that includes but not limited to the Kitchen, Dining room, Living room, Laundry room and main floor Bathroom. <br><br>So to accommodate everyone's needs we felt it was not right to charge everyone for minimum one bedroom for those who would like to keep their bedroom private and also for those who live in a studio apartment. <br><br>Our prices reflect this and the option is available to anyone who wants to have their bedrooms cleaned."

  {
    section: "general",
    question: "Do we need to have everything out of the house for a Move In/Move Out clean?",
    answer: "The short answer is Yes. We will clean everything in the house but we will need to have access to the house to do so. We will not be able to clean the inside of the fridge, oven, dishwasher, laundry machines, windows, blinds, walls, or inside cabinets and closets if the house is not empty.<br><br>If you are not able to have everything out of the house, we can work around it as long as certain parts of the house are empty and ready to be cleaned.

  {
    section: "services",
    question: "How can I get the most value out of my hourly house cleaning appointment?",
    answer: "Many people think that they have to have their entire home detailed when hiring a house cleaning company. This can leave you feeling a little overwhelmed by the cost. The truth is that you don't have to get everything done. Most people dread certain specific cleaning tasks, or they have areas in their home that bug them more than others. You can request to get just those things or areas done. It will make the cost much more reasonable, and you will still greatly benefit from having the service!<br><br>We offer a service that is built specifically for this! Our hourly Clean allows you to set a time that is within your budget. You then provide us with your checklist of cleaning duties you would like us to work down from. We highly suggest putting the tasks you hate doing most at the top of your list to ensure completion, so you won't get stuck doing them on your own later! We start at the top of your checklist, working our way down until your budgeted time is up. It's simple and straightforward. You can change your checklist as often as you like, and if you feel like you want more or less done in your home, you can update your budget too!<br><br><br>Other ways you can ensure you are getting value:<br><br>- Change your checklist prior to each appointment alternating rooms/areas that have not been cleaned in some time.<br><br>- Always start with a low budget, and work your way up. Most people are quite happy with just a little extra help.<br><br>-  Our hourly cleans start at 2 hours of cleaning time, this is reflected on the booking site as 2 cleaners for 1 hour."
  },
  {
    section: "general",
    question: "Are you pet friendly?",
    answer: "Yes we are pet friendly. All our cleaners are comfortable with your furry friends and will not hesitate to give them a little love while they are cleaning. All cleaning products are pet safe and we will not use any products that are not safe for your pets."
  },
  {
    section: "general",
    question: "Do I have to sign a contract?",
    answer: "We want our clients to want to use us. You are never required to sign a contract.  We are confident that you will want to use us again and again.<br><br>You can cancel anytime prior to your scheduled appointment without penalty. We would rather reschedule your appointment then have you upset because you were charged for a service you did not receive."
  },
  {
    section: "general",
    question: "I'm nervous/embarassed. I don't want someone to see my home.",
    answer: "If you're feeling this way, please try not to worry! Our cleaners are absolute professionals. This is what we love to do and what we excel at. We see it all, and there is no judgment. Our hope is that those feelings will dissipate as soon as your appointment starts and you see your home transform."
  },
  {
    section: "general",
    question: "How many cleaners will come?",
    answer: "We typically send 2 cleaners to your home. If you have a large home or a lot of cleaning to do we may send more. <br><br>For example: If you booked a 3 hour clean and 2 cleaner came to the appointment(6 cleaning hours), they would be there for the full 3 hours. If 3 cleaners came to the appointment, they would be there for 2 hours each, for a total of 6 hours. Please note that for larger cleans, we may send more cleaners to ensure all the work can get done in a single day."
  },
  {
    section: "general",
    question: "What if I'm not satisfied with the service?",
    answer: "Your satisfaction is our priority! If you're not completely happy with our service, please contact us within 24 hours and we'll return to address any concerns at no additional charge. We stand behind our work 100%."
  },
  {
    section: "general",
    question: "Is there anything the cleaners won't do?",
    answer: "<strong>Weight</strong> - We have a 20 lb. weight limit for safety reasons. We are accustomed to moving smaller items like dining table chairs, small ottomons, etc. to clean under. If you would like any heavier furniture or appliances cleaned under, you're welcome to move it and we'll be happy to clean under it upon request.<br><br><strong>Heights</strong> - We are limited to a 2 foot or shorter step stool. Safety is of the utmost importance to us. Please keep in mind that in most cases, the tops of kitchen cupboards are outside of our reach. Some lighting fixtures are also out of our reach.<br><br><strong>Outdoor Areas</strong> - Due to insurance purposes, we are not able to clean outdoor areas such as decks, patios, or gardens. Our insurance only covers the inside of the home.<br><br><strong>Pet Messes/Body Fluids</strong> - This includes, but is not limited to: litter boxes, pet messes, bird guano, blood, feces, urine, and overflowed toilets. Cleaning body fluids (including that of our furry friends) is something we do not do.<br><br><strong>Mold</strong> - Some amount of pink/orange mildew, or even darker mold, is common in some homes. Don't worry - we can clean small amounts of mold. Large amounts of mold in shower areas, on walls, etc. can affect air quality and pose a safety issue. We aren't able to clean in rooms that are heavily affected by mold, or in homes with heavy mold infestations.<br><br><strong>Carpet Cleaning</strong> - We do not offer carpet shampooing service."
