            Hi, I'm Lesia Buors — founder and hands-on owner of Tidy Fox
            Cleaning Services.<br /><br />

            Before starting Tidy Fox, I spent over 20 years working in customer
            service and the cleaning industry, including several management
            roles. I've always had a passion for helping people, and one of the
            things I enjoyed most was building real connections with clients.
            Starting my own company was a natural next step — I wanted the
            freedom to do things my way, with honesty, integrity, and attention
            to detail leading the way.<br /><br />

            For me, cleaning isn't just about tidying up a space. There's
            something deeply satisfying about turning an untidy home into a
            place that feels calm and refreshed. I love knowing that when a
            client walks through their front door, they'll feel that same sense
            of relief and joy. I've been there — balancing work, family, and
            trying to keep up with a house — and I know how much of a difference
            a clean home can make.<br /><br />

            What sets Tidy Fox apart is the personal care we put into every home
            we service. I still visit clients myself, pitch in on cleanings, and
            make the effort to truly get to know the families we work with. To
            me, our clients aren't just appointments on a schedule — they're
            people we care about. I take pride in offering a service that's not
            only reliable and consistent but also deeply rooted in trust.<br /><br />

            I'm proud to lead a hardworking, friendly, and detail-oriented team
            that shares my values. And I'm even prouder to have built a business
            where clients feel looked after, supported, and free to enjoy more
            time doing what they love.<br /><br />

            Thank you for being part of the Tidy Fox family — and for trusting
            us in your home.<br /><br />

            — Lesia
